        "## The Trajectory of a Ball!\n\nIn the first two examples, we applied the perturbation method to algebraic problems. However, the main power of the perturbation method is to solve differential equations (usually ODEs, but also occasionally PDEs). Surprisingly, the main procedure developed to solve algebraic problems works well for differential equations. In fact, we will use the same two helper functions, `collect_powers` and `solve_coef`. The main difference is in the way we expand the dependent variables. For algebraic problems, the coefficients of $\\epsilon$ are constants; whereas, for differential equations, they are functions of the dependent variable (usually time).\n\nAs the first ODE example, we have chosen a simple and well-behaved problem, which is a variation of a standard first-year physics problem: what is the trajectory of an object (say, a ball or a rocket) thrown vertically at velocity $v$ from the surface of a planet? Assuming a constant acceleration of gravity, $g$, every burgeoning physicist knows the answer: $x(t) = x(0) + vt - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$. However, what happens if $g$ is not constant? Specifically, $g$ is inversely proportional to the distant from the center of the planet. If $v$ is large and the projectile travels a large fraction of the radius of the planet, the assumption of constant gravity does not hold anymore. However, unless $v$ is large compared to the escape velocity, the correction is usually small. After simplifications and change of variables to dimensionless, the problem becomes\n\n$$\n  \\ddot{x}(t) = -\\frac{1}{(1 + \\epsilon x(t))^2}\n  \\,,\n$$\n\nwith the initial conditions $x(0) = 0$, and $\\dot{x}(0) = 1$. Note that for $\\epsilon = 0$, this equation transforms back to the standard one. Let's start with defining the variables"

Of course, we could have solved the problem directly using as ODE solver. One of the benefits of the perturbation method is that we need to run the ODE solver only once and then can just calculate the answer for different values of `𝜀`; whereas, if we had used the direct method, we would need to run the solver once for each value of `𝜀`.\n\n## A Weakly Nonlinear Oscillator\n\nFor the next example, we have chosen a simple example from a very important class of problems, the nonlinear oscillators. As we will see, perturbation theory has difficulty providing a good solution to this problem, but the process is instructive. This example closely follows the chapter 7.6 of *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* by Steven Strogatz.\n\nThe goal is to solve $\\ddot{x} + 2\\epsilon\\dot{x} + x = 0$, where the dot signifies time-derivatives and the initial conditions are $x(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 1$. If $\\epsilon = 0$, the problem reduces to the simple linear harmonic oscillator with the exact solution $x(t) = \\sin(t)$. We follow the same steps as the previous example."
