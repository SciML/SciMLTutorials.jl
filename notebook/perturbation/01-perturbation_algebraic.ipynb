        "## Background\n\n[**Symbolics.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl) is a fast and modern Computer Algebra System (CAS) written in the Julia Programming Language. It is an integral part of the [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) ecosystem of differential equation solvers and scientific machine learning packages. While **Symbolics.jl** is primarily designed for modern scientific computing (e.g., auto-differentiation, machine learning), it is a powerful CAS and can also be useful for *classic* scientific computing. One such application is using the *perturbation* theory to solve algebraic and differential equations.\n\nPerturbation methods are a collection of techniques to solve intractable problems that generally don't have a closed solution but depend on a tunable parameter and have closed or easy solutions for some values of the parameter. The main idea is to assume a solution as a power series in the tunable parameter (say $ϵ$), such that $ϵ = 0$ corresponds to an easy solution.\n\nWe will discuss the general steps of the perturbation methods to solve algebraic (this tutorial) and differential equations (*Mixed Symbolic/Numerical Methods for Perturbation Theory - Differential Equations*).\n\nThe hallmark of the perturbation method is the generation of long and convoluted intermediate equations, which are subjected to algorithmic and mechanical manipulations. Therefore, these problems are well suited for CAS. In fact, CAS softwares have been used to help with the perturbation calculations since the early 1970s.\n\nIn this tutorial our goal is to show how to use a mix of symbolic manipulations (**Symbolics.jl**) and numerical methods (**DifferentialEquations.jl**) to solve simple perturbation problems.\n\n## Solving the Quintic\n\nWe start with the \"hello world!\" analog of the perturbation problems, solving the quintic (fifth-order) equations. We want to find a real valued $x$ such that $x^5 + x = 1$. According to the Abel's theorem, a general quintic equation does not have a closed form solution. Of course, we can easily solve this equation numerically; for example, by using the Newton's method. We use the following implementation of the Newton's method:"

        "In this code, `Symbolics.derivative(eq, x)` does exactly what it names implies: it calculates the symbolic derivative of `eq` (a **Symbolics.jl** expression) with respect to `x` (a **Symbolics.jl** variable). We use `Symbolics.substitute(eq, D)` to evaluate the update formula by substituting variables or sub-expressions (defined in a dictionary `D`) in `eq`. It should be noted that `substitute` is the workhorse of our code and will be used multiple times in the rest of these tutorials. `solve_newton` is written with simplicity and clarity, and not performance, in mind but suffices for our purpose.\n\nLet's go back to our quintic. We can define a Symbolics variable as `@variables x` and then solve the equation `solve_newton(x^5 + x - 1, x, 1.0)` (here, `x₀ = 0` is our first guess). The answer is 0.7549. Now, let's see how we can solve the same problem using the perturbation methods.\n\nWe introduce a tuning parameter $\\epsilon$ into our equation: $x^5 + \\epsilon x = 1$. If $\\epsilon = 1$, we get our original problem. For $\\epsilon = 0$, the problem transforms to an easy one: $x^5 = 1$ which has an exact real solution $x = 1$ (and four complex solutions which we ignore here). We expand $x$ as a power series on $\\epsilon$:\n\n$$\n  x(\\epsilon) = a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + a_2 \\epsilon^2 + O(\\epsilon^3)\n  \\,.\n$$\n\n$a_0$ is the solution of the easy equation, therefore $a_0 = 1$. Substituting into the original problem,\n\n$$\n  (a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + a_2 \\epsilon^2)^5 + \\epsilon (a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + a_2 \\epsilon^2) - 1 = 0\n  \\,.\n$$\n\nExpanding the equations, we get\n$$\n  \\epsilon (1 + 5 a_1) + \\epsilon^2 (a_1 + 5 a_2 + 10 a1_2) + 𝑂(\\epsilon^3) = 0\n  \\,.\n$$\n\nThis equation should hold for each power of $\\epsilon$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n  1 + 5 a_1 = 0\n  \\,,\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n  a_1 + 5 a_2 + 10 a_1^2 = 0\n  \\,.\n$$\n\nThis system of equations does not initially seem to be linear because of the presence of terms like $10 a_1^2$, but upon closer inspection is found to be in fact linear (this is a feature of the perturbation methods). In addition, the system is in a triangular form, meaning the first equation depends only on $a_1$, the second one on $a_1$ and $a_2$, such that we can replace the result of $a_1$ from the first one into the second equation and remove the non-linear term. We solve the first equation to get $a_1 = -\\frac{1}{5}$. Substituting in the second one and solve for $a_2$:\n\n$$\n  a_2 = \\frac{(-\\frac{1}{5} + 10(-(\\frac{1}{5})²)}{5}  = -\\frac{1}{25}\n  \\,.\n$$\n\nFinally,\n\n$$\n  x(\\epsilon) = 1 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{5} - \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{25} + O(\\epsilon^3)\n  \\,.\n$$\n\nSolving the original problem, $x(1) = 0.76$, compared to 0.7548 calculated numerically. We can improve the accuracy by including more terms in the expansion of $x$. However, the calculations, while straightforward, become messy and intractable to do manually very quickly. This is why a CAS is very helpful to solve perturbation problems.\n\nNow, let's see how we can do these calculations in Julia. Let $n$ be the order of the expansion. We start by defining the symbolic variables:"

However, the presence of higher order terms in `eqs` prevents `Symbolics.solve_for(eqs .~ 0, a)` from workings properly.

The two functions `collect_powers` and `solve_coef(eqs, a)` are used in all the examples in this and the next tutorial.\n\n## Solving the Kepler's Equation\n\nHistorically, the perturbation methods were first invented to solve orbital calculations of the Moon and the planets. In homage to this history, our second example has a celestial theme. Our goal is solve the Kepler's equation:\n\n$$\n  E - e\\sin(E) = M\n  \\,.\n$$\n\nwhere $e$ is the *eccentricity* of the elliptical orbit, $M$ is the *mean anomaly*, and $E$ (unknown) is the *eccentric anomaly* (the angle between the position of a planet in an elliptical orbit and the point of periapsis). This equation is central to solving two-body Keplerian orbits.\n\nSimilar to the first example, it is easy to solve this problem using the Newton's method. For example, let $e = 0.01671$ (the eccentricity of the Earth) and $M = \\pi/2$. We have `solve_newton(x - e*sin(x) - M, x, M)` equals to 1.5875 (compared to π/2 = 1.5708). Now, we try to solve the same problem using the perturbation techniques (see function `test_kepler`).\n\nFor $e = 0$, we get $E = M$. Therefore, we can use $e$ as our perturbation parameter. For consistency with other problems, we also rename $e$ to $\\epsilon$ and $E$ to $x$.\n\nFrom here on, we use the helper function `def_taylor` to define Taylor's series by calling it as `x = def_taylor(ϵ, a, 1)`, where the arguments are, respectively, the perturbation variable, an array of coefficients (starting from the coefficient of $\\epsilon^1$), and an optional constant term."
