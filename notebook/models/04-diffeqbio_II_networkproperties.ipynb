        "#### Note on Using Network Property API Functions\nMany basic network query and reaction property functions are simply accessors,\nreturning information that is already stored within the generated\n`reaction_network`. For these functions, modifying the returned data structures\nmay lead to inconsistent internal state within the network. As such, they should\nbe used for accessing, but not modifying, network properties. The [API\ndocumentation](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/apis/diffeqbio.html)\nindicates which functions return newly allocated data structures and which\nreturn data stored within the `reaction_network`.\n\n---\n## Incremental Construction of Networks\nThe `@reaction_network` macro is monolithic, in that it not only constructs and\nstores basic network properties such as the reaction stoichiometries, but also\ngenerates **everything** needed to immediately solve ODE, SDE and jump models\nusing the network. This includes Jacobian functions, noise functions, and jump\nfunctions for each reaction. While this allows for a compact interface to the\nDifferentialEquations.jl solvers, it can also be computationally expensive for\nlarge networks, where a user may only wish to solve one type of problem and/or\nhave fine-grained control over what is generated. In addition, some types of\nreaction network structures are more amenable to being constructed\nprogrammatically, as opposed to writing out all reactions by hand within one\nmacro. For these reasons DiffEqBiological provides two additional macros that\nonly *initially* setup basic reaction network properties, and which can be\nextended through a programmatic interface: `@min_reaction_network` and\n`@empty_reaction_network`. We now give an introduction to constructing these\nmore minimal network representations, and how they can be programmatically\nextended. See also the relevant [API\nsection](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/apis/diffeqbio.html#Reaction-Network-Generation-Macros-1).\n\nThe `@min_reaction_network` macro works identically to the `@reaction_network`\nmacro, but the generated network will only be complete with respect to its\nrepresentation of chemical network properties (i.e. species, parameters and\nreactions). No ODE, SDE or jump models are generated during the macro call. It\ncan subsequently be extended with the addition of new species, parameters or\nreactions. The `@empty_reaction_network` allocates an empty network structure\nthat can also be extended using the programmatic interface. For example, consider\na partial version of the toggle-switch like network we defined above:"

However, for large, structured networks it can be much easier to\ngenerate the network programmatically. For very large networks, with tens of\nthousands of reactions, the form of `addreaction!` that uses stoichiometric\ncoefficients should be preferred as it offers substantially better performance.\nTo put together everything we've seen, let's generate the network corresponding\nto a 1D continuous time random walk, approximating the diffusion of molecules\nwithin an interval.\n\nThe basic \"reaction\" network we wish to study is \n\n$$\nu_1 \\leftrightarrows u_2 \\leftrightarrows u_3 \\cdots \\leftrightarrows u_{N}\n$$\n\nfor $N$ lattice sites on $[0,1]$. For $h = 1/N$ the lattice spacing, we'll\nassume the rate molecules hop from their current site to any particular neighbor\nis just $h^{-2}$. We can interpret this hopping process as a collection of\n$2N-2$ \"reactions\", with the form $u_i \\to u_j$ for $j=i+1$ or $j=i-1$. We construct\nthe corresponding reaction network as follows.
