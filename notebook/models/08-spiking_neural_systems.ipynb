        "This is an introduction to spiking neural systems with Julia's DifferentialEquations package.\nWe will cover three different models: leaky integrate-and-fire, Izhikevich, and Hodgkin-Huxley.\nFinally we will also learn about two mechanisms that simulate synaptic inputs like\nreal neurons receive them. The alpha synapse and the Tsodyks-Markram synapse. Let's get started\nwith the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model.\n## The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model\nThe LIF model is an extension of the integrate-and-fire (IF) model. While the IF\nmodel simply integrates input until it fires, the LIF model integrates input but\nalso decays towards an equilibrium potential. This means that inputs that arrive\nin quick succession have a much higher chance to make the cell spike as opposed\nto inputs that are further apart in time. The LIF is a more realistic neuron\nmodel than the IF, because it is known from real neurons that the timing of\ninputs is extremely relevant for their spiking.\n\nThe LIF model has five parameters, `gL, EL, C, Vth, I` and we define it in the `lif(u, p, t)` function."

        "Our system is described by one differential equation: `(-gL*(u-EL)+I)/C`, where\n`u` is the voltage, `I` is the input, `gL` is the leak conductance, `EL` is the\nequilibrium potential of the leak conductance and `C` is the membrane capacitance.\nGenerally, any change of the voltage is slowed down (filtered) by the membrane\ncapacitance. That's why we divide the whole equation by `C`. Without any external\ninput, the voltage always converges towards `EL`. If `u` is larger than `EL`,\n`u` decreases until it is at `EL`. If `u` is smaller than `EL`, `u` increases\nuntil it is at `EL`. The only other thing that can change the voltage is the\nexternal input `I`.\n\nOur `lif` function requires a certain parameter structure because it will need\nto be compatible with the `DifferentialEquations` interface. The input signature\nis `lif(u, p, t)` where `u` is the voltage, `p` is the collection of the parameters\nthat describe the equation and `t` is time. You might wonder why time does not\nshow up in our equation, although we need to calculate the change in voltage\nwith respect to time. The ODE solver will take care of time for us. One of\nthe advantages of the ODE solver as opposed to calculating the change of\n`u` in a for loop is that many ODE solver algorithms can dynamically adjust the\ntime step in a way that is efficient and accurate.\n\nOne crucial thing is still missing however. This is supposed to be a model of\nneural spiking, right? So we need a mechanism that recognizes the spike and\nhyperpolarizes `u` in response. For this purpose we will use callbacks.\nThey can make discontinuous changes to the model when certain conditions are met."

        "We see that the model is resting at `-75` while there is no input. At `t=2` the input increases by `210` and the model starts to spike. Spiking does not start immediately because the input first has to charge the membrane capacitance. Notice how once spiking starts it very quickly becomes extremely regular. Increasing the input again at `t=15` increases firing as we would expect but it is still extremely regular. This is one of the features of the LIF. The firing frequency is regular for constant input and a linear function of the input strength. There are ways to make LIF models less regular. For example we could use certain noise types at the input. We could also simulate a large number of LIF models and connect them synaptically. Instead of going into those topics, we will move on to the Izhikevich model, which is known for its ability to generate a large variety of spiking dynamics during constant inputs.\n\n## The Izhikevich Model\n[The Izhikevich model](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.htm) is a two-dimensional model of neuronal spiking. It was derived from a bifurcation analysis of a cortical neuron. Because it is two-dimensional it can generate much more complex spike dynamics than the LIF model. The kind of dynamics depend on the four parameters and the input `a, b, c, d, I = p`. All the concepts are the same as above, expect for some minor changes to our function definitions to accomodate for the second dimension."

This second dimension is called `u` in the original Izhikevich work amnd it makes the notation a little annoying. In this tutorial I will generally stick to Julia and `DifferentialEquations` conventions as opposed to conventions of the specific models and `du` is commonly used. We will never define `du` ourselves outside of the function but the ODE solver will use it internally. The other change here is the `!` after our function name. This signifies that `du` will be preallocated before integration and then updated in-place, which saves a lot of allocation time.

They increase or decrease depending on the voltage. In ion channel terms, open channels can transition to the closed state and closed channels can transition to the open state. It's probably easiest to start with the potassium current described by `gK * (n^4.0) * (EK - v)`. Here `gK` is the total possible conductance that we could reach if all potassium channels were open. If all channels were open, `n` would equal 1 which is usually not the case. The transition from open state to closed state is modeled in `alpha_n(v)` while the transition from closed to open is in `beta_n(v)`. Because potassium conductance is voltage gated, these transitions depend on `v`. The numbers in `alpha_n; beta_n` were calculated by Hodgkin and Huxley based on their extensive experiments on the squid giant axon. They also determined, that `n` needs to be taken to the power of 4 to correctly model the amount of open channels.\n\nThe sodium current is not very different but it has two gating variables, `m, h` instead of one. The leak conductance gL has no gating variables because it is not voltage gated. Let's move on to the parameters.

The number and frequency of synaptic events changes the size of the maximum conductance in a dynamic way. While we usually avoid anatomical and biophysical details of real synapses, there is a widely used phenomenological way to capture those dynamics called the Tsodyks-Markram synapse.\n\n## Tsodyks-Markram Synapse\nThe Tsodyks-Markram synapse (TMS) is a dynamic system that models the changes of maximum conductance that occur between EPSPs at different frequencies. The single response is similar to the alpha synapse in that it rises instantaneously and decays exponentially. The maximum conductance it reaches depends on the event history. To simulate the TMS we need to incorporate three more dimensions, `u, R, gsyn` into our system. `u` decays towards 0, R decays towards 1 and gsyn decays towards 0 as it did with the alpha synapse. The crucial part of the TMS is in `epsp!`, where we handle the discontinuities when a synaptic event occurs. Instead of just setting `gsyn` to the maximum conductance `gmax`, we increment `gsyn` by a fraction of gmax that depends on the other two dynamic parameters. The frequency dependence comes from the size of the time constants `tau_u` and `tau_R`. Enough talk, let's simulate it."
