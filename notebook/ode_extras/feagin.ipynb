        "DifferentialEquations.jl includes Feagin's explicit Runge-Kutta methods of orders 10/8, 12/10, and 14/12. These methods have such high order that it's pretty much required that one uses numbers with more precision than Float64. As a prerequisite reference on how to use arbitrary number systems (including higher precision) in the numerical solvers, please see the Solving Equations in With Chosen Number Types notebook.\n\n## Investigation of the Method's Error\n\nWe can use Feagin's order 16 method as follows. Let's use a two-dimensional linear ODE. Like in the Solving Equations in With Chosen Number Types notebook, we change the initial condition to BigFloats to tell the solver to use BigFloat types.\n# Feagin&#39;s Order 10, 12, and 14 Methods\n### Chris Rackauckas"

The following convergence test is used in the package tests in order to make sure the implementation is correct. Note that all methods have such tests in place."
