        "## Basic Introduction Via Ordinary Differential Equations\n\nThis notebook will get you started with DifferentialEquations.jl by introducing you to the functionality for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The corresponding documentation page is the [ODE tutorial](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/ode_example.html). While some of the syntax may be different for other types of equations, the same general principles hold in each case. Our goal is to give a gentle and thorough introduction that highlights these principles in a way that will help you generalize what you have learned.\n\n### Background\n\nIf you are new to the study of differential equations, it can be helpful to do a quick background read on [the definition of ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation). We define an ordinary differential equation as an equation which describes the way that a variable $u$ changes, that is\n\n$$u' = f(u,p,t)$$\n\nwhere $p$ are the parameters of the model, $t$ is the time variable, and $f$ is the nonlinear model of how $u$ changes. The initial value problem also includes the information about the starting value:\n\n$$u(t_0) = u_0$$\n\nTogether, if you know the starting value and you know how the value will change with time, then you know what the value will be at any time point in the future. This is the intuitive definition of a differential equation.\n\n### First Model: Exponential Growth\n\nOur first model will be the canonical exponential growth model. This model says that the rate of change is proportional to the current value, and is this:\n\n$$u' = au$$\n\nwhere we have a starting value $u(0)=u_0$. Let's say we put 1 dollar into Bitcoin which is increasing at a rate of $98\\%$ per year. Then calling now $t=0$ and measuring time in years, our model is:\n\n$$u' = 0.98u$$\n\nand $u(0) = 1.0$. We encode this into Julia by noticing that, in this setup, we match the general form when\n# An Intro to DifferentialEquations.jl\n### Chris Rackauckas"

We will detail some of the most widely used options.\n\nThe most useful options are the tolerances `abstol` and `reltol`. These tell the internal adaptive time stepping engine how precise of a solution you want. Generally, `reltol` is the relative accuracy while `abstol` is the accuracy when `u` is near zero. These tolerances are local tolerances and thus are not global guarantees. However, a good rule of thumb is that the total solution accuracy is 1-2 digits less than the relative tolerances. Thus for the defaults `abstol=1e-6` and `reltol=1e-3`, you can expect a global accuracy of about 1-2 digits. If we want to get around 6 digits of accuracy, we can use the commands:"

When you call `solve(prob)`, DifferentialEquations.jl makes a guess at a good algorithm for your problem, given the properties that you ask for (the tolerances, the saving information, etc.). However, in many cases you may want more direct control. A later notebook will help introduce the various *algorithms* in DifferentialEquations.jl, but for now let's introduce the *syntax*.\n\nThe most crucial determining factor in choosing a numerical method is the stiffness of the model. Stiffness is roughly characterized by a Jacobian `f` with large eigenvalues. That's quite mathematical, and we can think of it more intuitively: if you have big numbers in `f` (like parameters of order `1e5`), then it's probably stiff. Or, as the creator of the MATLAB ODE Suite, Lawrence Shampine, likes to define it, if the standard algorithms are slow, then it's stiff. We will go into more depth about diagnosing stiffness in a later tutorial, but for now note that if you believe your model may be stiff, you can hint this to the algorithm chooser via `alg_hints = [:stiff]`."

DifferentialEquations.jl respects your input types to determine the internal types that are used. Thus since in the previous cases, when we used `Float64` values for the initial condition, this meant that the internal values would be solved using `Float64`. We made sure that time was specified via `Float64` values, meaning that time steps would utilize 64-bit floats as well. But, by simply changing these types we can change what is used internally.\n\nAs a quick example, let's say we want to solve an ODE defined by a matrix. To do this, we can simply use a matrix as input."

        "## Conclusion\n\nThese are the basic controls in DifferentialEquations.jl. All equations are defined via a problem type, and the `solve` command is used with an algorithm choice (or the default) to get a solution. Every solution acts the same, like an array `sol[i]` with `sol.t[i]`, and also like a continuous function `sol(t)` with a nice plot command `plot(sol)`. The Common Solver Options can be used to control the solver for any equation type. Lastly, the types used in the numerical solving are determined by the input types, and this can be used to solve with arbitrary precision and add additional optimizations (this can be used to solve via GPUs for example!). While this was shown on ODEs, these techniques generalize to other types of equations as well."
